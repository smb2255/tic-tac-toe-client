Game Info:
- First the user has the option to sign up or sign in (if user has proviously signed up).
- Once signed in, the user can click on the START GAME button to begin a game. The user will then be able to see the game board.
- The game can then be played- switching turns between player X and player O.
- A user can see his/her total games played by clicking on the SEE YOUR STATS button.
- A user's password can be changed at any point after the user signs in.
- Once a winner has been declared a user can either play another game without logging out- by hittin the RESET button. Or the user can sign out, by hittin the SIGN OUT button- and the page will return to just the signin/up display.

Future potential:
- I would like to work on the styling of the game (CSS, HTML)- since that is something I did not have much time to do. This is definitely something that I will work on for my portfolio.
- I would like to have the username appear instead of "player x" for each turn- making the game more personal. Additionally, I would like to figure out how two users (both X and O) could sign in and play the same game.

Wireframes:
See two pictures attached.
- Becasue I didn't have time to focus on the styling, my wireframes do not look like my finished product does.
